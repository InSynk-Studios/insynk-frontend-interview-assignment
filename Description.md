3. I applied redux for state management, I have implemented it via latest redux toolkit.
4. In redux tool kit I created two slices one for category and one for Expense object.
5. To persist data even after reload I am saving data on local storage for which i have used local storage middleware.
6. I have created 3 reducers for Expense slice which are add, remove and remove by category to facilitate deleting of category  along with its all expenses.
7. I'm sorting the dates in decreasing order on the basis of year and if year is same then on months.
8. for Displaying the expenses for month to month basis I segregated the expenses on the basis of month.
9. for editing the expense on edit expense page I'm passing the data as params and then removing the old object from redux store and adding new object.
